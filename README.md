PyPA Interoperability PEPs
==========================

This is the development repo for the definition and evolution of PyPA interoperability standards. Released versions of these standards are published as PEPs on python.org.

PEPs in this repo are always considered working drafts, regardless of their PEP metadata headers - the official versions are the ones published on python.org by the respective PEP authors and accepted by the assigned BDFL-Delegates.

Naming guidelines
-----------------

To avoid folks needing to mentally map between the interoperability PEP numbers and their topics, the naming convention for PEPs in this repo is:

    pep-<4 digit PEP number>-<topic>.rst

So, for example, the PEP 440 versioning specification is:

    pep-0440-versioning.rst
